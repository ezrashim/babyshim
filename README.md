# BabyShim

BabyShim is an announcement app with a messaging functionality that allows users to check how many days are left until their baby is due. The site is created using Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL database, Foundation front end with custom CSS, and Customized Javascript timer.

My first client, my wife, asked me if I could build a simple web app to announce her pregnancy to her friends with a countdown function. BabyShim was created so that users can not only learn about the news, but also leave comments for us as a couple to celebrate together with our dear friends and family.
